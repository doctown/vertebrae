## Introduction


### Technologies

  - [Backbone.js]

### Context

Backbone is the first of many MVC (model-view-controller) frameworks
you will be introduced to. It is the most prevalent framework in use today.

Maybe you've seen MVC before, but this introduction assumes no knowledge.
You'll walk through the basics, and see how a simple application might work.

Work through the tutorial steps - _without going ahead_ - for an
introduction to Backbone's flavor of MVC:
- models
 - The persistent application data
- views
 - The rendered data visible to the user
- collections
 - Groupings of models using underscore functions

Eventually, we'll move on to other MVC frameworks like Angular, Ember,
and Mithril. For now, put on your blinders, and dive into backbone.
